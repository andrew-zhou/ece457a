\section{Literature Review}
Previous research in the field of three dimensional path planning has focused on the single-agent problem and has traditionally looked at genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) approaches. Studies in this field have motivated the techniques utilised in this paper both through the algorithms for single-drone path finding as well as the reduction of a real three-dimensional space into a graph of waypoints.

A key optimization conducted in this paper is the reduction of real three-dimensional spaces into adjacency lists of waypoints. Doing this minimizes the search space drastically, enabling the path planning techniques to be more effective on a wider range of potential spaces. This reduction is done by grouping neighbouring points into waypoints and then calculating an average real-world cost to move between neighbouring waypoints. Studies on real-time UAV path planning suggest that the cost for a drone to move between points is determined by distance, altitude, power consumption, fuel usage, ground collisions, and whether or not the drone must traverse through danger zones \cite{b1}. To translate this from points to waypoints, this paper treats the position of the waypoint as the center point within the space that it occupies. Then the resulting cost function is:
$$F_{cost} = C_{length} + C_{altitude} + C_{danger zones}$$
$$ + C_{power} + C_{collision} + C_{fuel}$$

Prior studies have thus far been inconclusive in determining whether GA techniques are superior to PSO techniques for the single-drone problem \cite{b2} or vice-versa \cite{b3}. Additionally, the addition of multiple simultaneous drones adds a major consideration which these techniques do not take into account. This lack of conclusiveness prevented this paper's techniques from being fully rooted in the traditional methods discussed in the literature. Nevertheless, those approaches are taken into account.

The multi-drone path planning techniques discussed in this paper break down the problem into a series of single-drone path planning subproblems. These subproblems are solved using a combination of techniques similar to the literature (GA-based) as well as more novel approaches through ant colony optimization (ACO) methods. The methods for reducing the multi-drone problem are themselves unique and not considered in prior literature.
